//widget.h - the per-control vtable.
//
//each gui_node_type has exactly one widget_vtable registered for it
//(via widget_registry__register, called from each widget's
//widget_<name>__register function). scene.c, parser_xml.c, and the
//input dispatcher look up the vtable by node type and call into the
//hooks below instead of switching on type.
//
//to add a new control:
//  1. add an enum value to gui_node_type in gui.h (before
//     GUI_NODE_TYPE_COUNT).
//  2. create gui/src/widgets/widget_<name>.c that defines a static
//     widget_vtable, fills in only the hooks it needs, and exposes
//     a single widget_<name>__register(void).
//  3. add the extern declaration + the call to that register
//     function in widget_registry.c's bootstrap.
//
//hooks left as NULL fall through to safe defaults (no-op behavior,
//bg-only draw, no input handling).
//

//
// Widget capability flags. Future-proofs the vtable: new bits can
// be added without growing the struct. The four legacy boole
// fields below (consumes_click / takes_focus / captures_drag /
// preserves_focus) are kept for backwards compatibility -- scene
// reads BOTH the bit and the boole and treats either-set as TRUE.
// New widgets can use either form; eventually the booles get
// removed once nothing references them.

    // still called first so widgets can release GPU textures /
    // sub-allocations stashed inside the state struct before the
    // outer GUI_FREE happens.
